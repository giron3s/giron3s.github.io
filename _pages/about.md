Hi, I am Marc Girones and I work as a senior game programmer at Winsystem in Sant Cugat, Spain. 

In 2013, I graduated a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at University of Barcelona. During the university years I decided to professionalize my passion (video game/ computer graphics). So my final year project was related with Computer Graphics, the project was a motion capture. 

Then I decided to continue my studies, so I was started master degree in Video Game Design at University.

Actualy i working in game industry and i keep learning, deepen my knowledge and growing as a human being and as a professional in the computer science world. I had been working within an organisation where I can further strengthen the research, design and coding skills. I feel that my organised and dedicated approach to work, my creativity and my positive attitude would be strong assets to bring to any team.
