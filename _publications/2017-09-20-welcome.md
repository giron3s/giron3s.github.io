# Hi everyone!
I’m Marc Girones, your host on My Personal Blog!

I started this blog to share my experience with programming in C++ I
gathered over the years, working as a programmer. I hope that
someone might find this knowledge useful.

## What to expect
Posts will vary in content but will be mainly programming related.

I’ll use this blog as an excuse to develop some ideas further so we can
show them. Most of them will be Proofs of Concept but I’m planning on
writing about some general Computer Science topics like Data
Structures and Algorithms, or talking about some key features of
programming languages and frameworks.

So let’s get it started and I hope you enjoy the reading!
