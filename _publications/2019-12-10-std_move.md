# Problem

Here I'm back, on my series of C++. Today we're going to be talking about the **std::move** semantics. This is probably one of the most requested topic.
In this article, I would like to make a introduction, because the basic of std::move is very simple, but then what you can do with it... it could be very complex.


Before to continue this article, I highly recomend that *read the my article about the lvalues and rvalues from [HERE](/publications/2019-11-01-lvalues_and_rvalues)*, because this article more or less going to be a continuation of that article.


# The Basics

Move semantics essentially just allow us to move objects around. This wasn't possible before C++11. The C++11 introduced the rvalue references, which are necessery for the move semantics. 
The basic idea is when we are writing a C++ code, there are lot of cases in which we don't really need to or want to necessarily copy an object one place from the other.


For example: 
- If passing an object into a function that then is going to take the ownership of that object, i have no choice to move it. I need to copy

- The same things occur when I want to return an object from a function. I still have to create that object inside that actual function and then return it. Which means that I'm coping that data again.


Yes... I know...Now many reader says..

Let's write the example why exactly we might want to move something.

{% highlight c++ %}
class String
{
public:
	String() = default;

	String(const char* aStr)
	{
		printf("CONSTRUCTOR!\n");
		mSize = strlen(aStr);
		mData = new char[mSize];
		memcpy(mData, aStr, mSize);
	}

	~String()
	{
		printf("DESTRUCTOR!\n");
		delete mData;
	}


	String(const String& aOther)
	{
		printf("COPY CONSTRUCTOR!\n");
		mSize = aOther.mSize;
		mData = new char[mSize];
		memcpy(mData, aOther.mData, aOther.mSize);
	}


	void Print()
	{

		for(uint32_t i = 0; i < mSize; ++i)
  			printf("%c", mData[i]);
		printf("\n");
	}

private:
	char*    mData;
	uint32_t mSize;

};


string Entity
{
public:
	Entity(const String& aName)
		: mName(aName)
	{


	}

	void Print()
	{
		mName.Print();
	}
private:
	String mName;
}


int main()
{

	Entity lEntity( String("MyEntity") );
	lEntity.Print();
}
{% endhighlight  c++ %}


It look all fine? Right? Let's execute our code. 

{% highlight c++ %}
>> CONSTRUCTOR
>> COPY CONSTRUCTOR
>> MyEntity
>> DESTRUCTOR
{% endhighlight  c++ %}

Where is the problem? The answer is at the **COPY CONSTRUCTOR** line print. This means that our data was copied. 
Why it is a problem? It is a problem, because when we copy the string, we need to allocate the memory on the heap with *mData = new char[mSize];*. Say with the other words, when we excecute the *Entity lEntity( String("MyEntity") );* we are allocate the memory **TWICE**. Create first of the scope of *" String("MyEntity")"* and then the secondly at *"Entity(const String& aName): mName(aName)"* we are copy the aName to the mName.


### So the question why can't we just allocate the memory and then move it onto the other place? What we need to do?


# The std::move


{% highlight c++ %}
class String
{
public:
	String() = default;

	String(const char* aStr)
	{
		printf("CONSTRUCTOR!\n");
		mSize = strlen(aStr);
		mData = new char[mSize];
		memcpy(mData, aStr, mSize);
	}

	~String()
	{
		printf("DESTRUCTOR!\n");
		delete mData;
	}

	//Move contructor
	String(String&& aOther) noexcept
	{
		printf("MOVE CONSTRUCTOR!\n");
		mSize = aOther.mSize;
		mData = aOther.mData;

		aOther.mData = nullptr;
		aOther.mSize = 0;
	}


	void Print()
	{

		for(uint32_t i = 0; i < mSize; ++i)
  			printf("%c", mData[i]);
		printf("\n");
	}

private:
	char*    mData;
	uint32_t mSize;

};


string Entity
{
public:
	Entity(String&& aName)
		: mName(std::move( aName ) )
	{


	}

	void Print()
	{
		mName.Print();
	}
private:
	String mName;
}


int main()
{

	Entity lEntity( String("MyEntity") );
	lEntity.Print();
}
{% endhighlight  c++ %}

And run the above code, we got the following output:

{% highlight c++ %}
>> CONSTRUCTOR
>> MOVE CONSTRUCTOR
>> MyEntity
>> DESTRUCTOR
{% endhighlight  c++ %}


It cool? Right?

The major point of this is that we saved using the **copy constructor** to allocate the new block of memory and copy it. We are simply manage to move that instead. 
We have only the single allocation.
